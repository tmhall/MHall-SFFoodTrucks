Suggestions include
* Write a web API that returns a set of food trucks.
* Write a web frontend that visualizes the nearby food trucks for a given place.
* Create a CLI that lets us get the names of all the taco trucks in the city.
* Create system that spits out a container with a placeholder webpage featuring the name of each food truck to help their marketing efforts.

The source data is located at
